# Bamazon!!!
BAMAZON is an Amazon-like storefront. Customers have the ability to browse through products in different departments. 

The customer selects which product they want to purchase by entering the product's ID number. 

Next, the customer is prompted to enter in the amount of items they want to purchase. If BAMAZON has stock, the customer gets the total and the store's inventory will be updated in MySQL.
